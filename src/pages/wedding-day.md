All guests will be at the ceremony venue by 2.30 pm for a 2.50 pm seating.

The first few rows of seating will be available for immediate family and the bridal party at the ceremony. All our guests are special to both of us so please sit on either side you like.

The ceremony will last for approximately 30min followed by canapés, drinks and lawn games until the reception begins.

## Reception

6.00pm – 11.30pm

The reception will be at the same location as the ceremony after the canapés, drinks and lawn games, so no need to go anywhere, just enjoy the views, drinks, food and company!

To celebrate in our true style with our family and friends we will be having a walk and fork style menu designed around our favourite foods shared throughout the night which means no seating plans! Sit wherever you like and enjoy the food!

Please let us know of any dietary requirements when letting us know your RSVP.
