Due to the remote location of our Wedding, accommodation overnight will be required. There are two amazing accommodation options which we have assigned to guests depending on their needs. Once you have RSVP we will provide you with your room number. The venue has kindly offered special rates for the accommodation of $150 per person, with payment to be made via bank transfer.

## Ben Lomond

Bursting with rustic charm, Ben Lomond lodge will give you an authentic New Zealand experience. With shared rooms and single beds which can sleep up to 34 guests. 5 triangle chalets for accommodation and a central building that has a living room with fireplace and a long dining room. If you have been assigned a room at Ben Lomond transport will be arranged to take you to the ceremony and back to your room any time after dinner.

## Moonlight Lodge

Situated deep within the station, Moonlight Lodge has rooms that are situated next to the Wedding reception for an easy walk back to your room.

Both accommodation options will have everything you need including towels, toiletries and bedding, just bring a change of clothes! Make sure to bring a jacket in case it does get cooler at night.

We will keep the celebrations going with a delicious chef-cooked breakfast the next morning at 10.00 am.
