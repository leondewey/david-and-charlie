---
David and Charlie’s love story began at the Bannockburn Hotel where before they even knew they were in love they were sharing food and drinks. Charlie worked at the bar and David was a customer, one way to get David’s attention was for Charlie to invite herself to the table to eat his food, and of course David allowed it. After a few weeks of Charlie driving David and his mates home after one too many beers, they began to fall for each other and the next thing they knew, Charlie had moved in! 

Fast forward 3 years, many adventures, so much love and a beautiful dog Harry, in their caravan they had renovated together on the pristine lake at Paradise, Glenorchy David dropped to one knee and asked Charlie to be his forever person. They shared a very special bottle of bubbles that had been saved for this exact occasion and enjoyed the night together in the middle of nowhere!

Four years together now, they are cannot wait to marry each other next year and share their love story with their closest family and friends. David has always loved Charlie’s smile and Charlie is in awe at David being able to make her smile no matter what, which they are sure their Wedding day will bring the biggest smiles of all!
