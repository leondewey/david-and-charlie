Our love story began at the Bannockburn Hotel where we first became friends through sharing food and drinks. Charlie was working at the bar while David was a customer. One way for Charlie to get David’s attention was to invite herself to the table to eat his food - and, of course, David allowed it! After a few weeks of driving David and his mates home after one-too-many beers, we realised we had begun to fall for each other - and the next thing we knew, we had moved in together!

Fast forward three years, after many adventures, so much love, getting beautiful dog Harry, and a new home, and doing the caravan renovation together, we knew we would spend the rest of our lives together. In the caravan, under the stars, and in the pristine, Paradise, Glenorchy, David got down on one knee and asked Charlie to be his forever person. Charlie, of course, said “yes”! We shared a very special bottle of bubbles that had been saved for this exact occasion and enjoyed the night together in the middle of nowhere!

Four years together now, we cannot wait to marry each other in February and share our happiness with our closest family and friends. David continues to love Charlie’s smile and Charlie is in awe at David being able to make her smile no matter what. We know our special day will bring even more reason to smile as we begin the next part of our adventures together.
