Our Wedding venue is nestled deep in 33,000 acre Ben Lomond Station with access via 4WD or Helicopter only, as part of the RSVP please do let us know which transport option you would like to take.



**Helicopter**

The helicopter transport option is an 8 minute flight from The Helicopter Line, Lucas Place Frankton, Queenstown to Moonlight Lodge, each helicopter seats 6 people with limited luggage space. We can assist you with sharing a helicopter if you do need to make up the numbers. The venue has kindly offered special rates for the helicopter flight at approximately $300 per person return, with payments to be made via bank transfer.



**4WD**

The 4WD track is a beautifully scenic self driven trip. The trip will take approximately 45 minutes including 5 river crossings. This track is for experienced drivers only and we can organise carpooling for those that do not wish to drive themselves. Please let us know when you RSVP if you require this.

We suggest eating some lunch prior to travelling to the Wedding.

Please don’t forget to let us know your preferred transport options in the RSVP – including your return option.
